# localua.sh

localua.sh is a Bash script to download and install a self-contained Lua and
LuaRocks on Linux, macOS and MSYS2.

It supports Lua 5.1 to 5.3. It does *not* officially support other operating
systems or environments, and it does *not* support LuaJIT.

If this does not fit your needs, check out:
